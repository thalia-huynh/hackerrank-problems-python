I'm looking to go beyond the descriptive stats and work alongside other bright professionals to find patterns in the data, make predictions, and address business problems."

    "\n",
    "Of all of my data analyst projects at Kaiser, I was most proud of (and intrigued by) the study that dealth with ACE (adverse childhood experiences) scores and how pregnant women with higher ACE scores are less likely to seek help and show up to prenatal appointments. This project dealt with going through freely written notes from the patients' medical charts -- and, as you'd expect, those notes were a hot mess to deal with. That was when I self-taught myself regex so that I could better locate the pieces of information that I needed. I was preiously intimidated by regex but eventually learned to enjoy it. This experience led me to become more interested in text data."

    "The law of large numbers is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that describes the behavior of the average of a large number of independent random variables. Specifically, it states that as the number of trials or samples increases, the average or expected value of the random variables approaches the true expected value or mean of the underlying distribution.<br><br>\n",

    "The central limit theorem (CLT) is another important theorem in probability theory that describes the behavior of the sum or average of a large number of independent random variables. Specifically, it states that under certain conditions, the sum or average of independent random variables will tend to follow a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the original variables.<br><br>\n",

    "The central limit theorem is a powerful result that has many applications in statistics, econometrics, finance, and other fields. It allows us to make inferences about the distribution of sample means or sums, even when we do not know the underlying distribution of the original variables.<br><br>\n",
